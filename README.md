# INTRODUCTION
In this analysis, I will be using the SQL programming language to create database,create tables and import data into the database so data for the business can be stored,updated,altered and queried when the need arises.
___

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
I intend to query the data within this database in the following ways;
* ⁠is it true that most of the customers that are yet to pay for their orders this year are the ones that their cards expire in February this year?
* which cities did we deliver the least number of chargers to in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2022?
* how many orders do we still have on the way to the customers this year?
___

# DATABASE CREATION
* I created the database where all the data for this business can be properly stored,updated,altered and queried when the need arises.
* I also created different tables connecting them to each other by defining the primary keys and foreign keys where neccessary using some complex codes.
* I imported data into these tables following some technical procedures
